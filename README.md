### Overall Application's Concept
**A meal plan generator browser-based app** that allows the user to save searched recipes to weekly meal planner


### The Motivation for Development
The main problem that most busy parents with little kids have is that **they don't know what to feed their kids**. They know the important of meal planning. There are tons of free family meal planning templates they can find on Pinterest. However, they are too busy to sit down and plan a meal for the whole week. Most of all, One of the parents often has no clue what should the kids have for dinner. These parents just want something super easy, portable, and shareable. 

Wouldn't it be nice if someone (in this case, us as developers!) builds a meal plan generator that helps the user searchs and selects a recipe to a weekly meal planner, and be able to share it to other caregivers! 

### Technologies used
* [EDAMAM's Recipe Search API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api) _returns recipes from  popular recipes sources on the web_
* [ZOMATO API](https://developers.zomato.com/api) _returns restaurants in the area_
* [html2canvas JS](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) _takes screenshots with JavaScript_

### Product features
* Search for recipes, use starter meal ideas, or random a classic menu
* Select a recipe and add it to a weekly meal planner
* Save recipes to your username
* Export a planner to an image and share it to family members

### Direction for future development
* Customize random search generator with user's cooking habit preference i.e., home-cooking, store-bought, carry-out parents
* Add search filters by calories, diet or allergy restrictions
* Help the user manage household better by showing cost of total meal
